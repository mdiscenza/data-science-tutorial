# Learning Data Science

### Goals - overall
- Understand the different aspects of skils/knowledge you want to learn
    + data cleaning/structuring
    + data analysis
    + statistical modeling
    + productionalizing work for real products
    + understanding what tools to use when
- Figure out the toolsets and models that are most relevant to learn and that you can apply easily to the datasets/problems we have here


### Sets of Statistics/Machine Learning Problems and how we solve them
- regresssion (supervised learning)
- classification (supervised learning)
- clustering (unsupervised learning)
- various specific configuration of these techniques/hybridization of these techniques


### Toolsets we want to use:
- R -> what I'm best at, but not as widely applicable
- **Python -> what is probably the most practical option for both of us**
